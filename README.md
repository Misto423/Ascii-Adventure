Ascii-Adventure
===============

A zelda clone in c# console.

Features 9 dungeons, several items and sword, shops, and various enemies.

Mostly finished.  Never got around to save/load feature, and some of the randomization needs adjusted.  But it is playable to the final dungeon.

To complete a dungeon, you must explore all the rooms to find the dragon.  Once the dragon is defeated, he drops an orb that will take you to the next level.
