<h1>Ascii-Adventure</h1>
<i><b>A zelda clone in C# console</b></i>

<h2>Summary</h2>
Features 9 dungeons, several items and sword, shops, and various enemies.

<h2>Status</h2>
Mostly finished.  Never got around to save/load feature, and some of the randomization needs adjusted.  But it is playable to the final dungeon.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
To complete a dungeon, you must explore all the rooms to find the dragon.  Once the dragon is defeated, he drops an orb that will take you to the next level.
